Have you ever wanted to share an excerpt from a podcast with someone? InstaClip Share to the rescue! The extension makes an audio clip of a podcast and attaches it to a message that you can send.

The host app provides a hard coded audio file url and current play time to the share extension (Iâ€™ll fix the hard coded file limitation in the next version). The share extension gets the parameters, makes the clip, attaches it to a MFMessageComposeViewController and then presents it for the user to send.
