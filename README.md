InstaClip Share
===============

An iOS Share Extension written in Swift 2.0 and Xcode 7 beta 5

Have you ever wanted to share an excerpt from a podcast with someone? InstaClip Share to the rescue! The extension makes an audio clip of a podcast and attaches it to a message that you can send.

In this version I focused solely on a bare bones clip creator in the share extension. The host app provides a hard coded audio file url and current play time to the share extension (Iâ€™ll fix the hard coded file limitation in the next version). The share extension gets the parameters, makes the clip, attaches it to a MFMessageComposeViewController and then presents it for the user to send.

Notes:
You have to run InstaClip Player first to load the app. Then switch schemes to InstaClip Share, run and choose InstaClip Player. On your first share you will have to select More... and enable InstaClip Share. The first run with the debugger is slow, otherwise its quick.
